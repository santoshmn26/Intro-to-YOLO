Introduction to objection detection using YOLO
# YOLO - Deep Learning

Welcome to the world of object detection!

YOLO is like a hello world program for object detection using Deep learning.
YOLO stands for "You Look only once". It is a real time object detection model.

Original paper: [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640v5.pdf).
                [YOLOv2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242v1.pdf).

## Features         

Yolo:   Speed 45 FPS, Fairly accurate.
Yolov2: Speed 155 FPS, Less accurate.

Yolo can be compared to FCNN rather than RCNN, It splites the images into MxM grids
It is a fully functional convolutional neural network that passes an image once through the FCNN
and determines the predections.
A single convolutional network simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes.
